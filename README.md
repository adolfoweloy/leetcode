# Leetcode exercises

This repository contains solutions to Leetcode problems where I try to save different approaches to solve sometimes
similar problems and how I track my practice around main topics in data-structures and algorithms. 

I've organised the packages in this repo, splitting them by categories mostly related to data-structures, each
sub-package of `com.adolfoeloy` should have the name of a data-structure.

!There may be exceptions to this rule, because some problems fit into many categories/data-structures.
